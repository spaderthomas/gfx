Building the more general perspective projection matrix using the extends of the
viewing plane. Also shows how to derive the perspective projection, and then
explains why the homogeneous coordinate ends up being the Z coordinate.

Another derivation of the general perspective projection matrix. Sometimes one
gets confusing.
